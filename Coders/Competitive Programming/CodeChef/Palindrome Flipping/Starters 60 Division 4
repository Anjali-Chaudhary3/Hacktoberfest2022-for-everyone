Problem:
Chef has a binary string S of length N.
In one operation, Chef can:

Select two indices i and j (1 <= i, j <=N, i not equal to j)(1≤i,j≤N,i=j) and flip Si and Sj (i.e. change 00 to 11 and 11 to 00)

For example, if S = 10010 and chef applys operation on i = 1 and j = 3 then: 10010→00110.

Find if it is possible to convert SS to a palindrome by applying the above operation any (possibly zero) number of times.

Note: A string is called a palindrome if it reads the same backwards and forwards, for e.g. 1000110001 and 01100110 are palindromic strings.

Input Format :
The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N — the length of the binary string S.
The second line of each test case contains a binary string S of length N containing 0 and 1 only.

Output Format :
For each test case, output YES if it is possible to convert SS to a palindrome. Otherwise, output NO.

You can print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings YES, yes, Yes, and yEs are all considered the same.

Constraints :
1≤T≤10^5
1≤N≤10^5
S contains 0 and 1 only.
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2.10^52


Sample 1:

6
101011
2
01
7
1110000
Output 
YES
NO
YES

Solution:-
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--)
	{
	    int n;
	    cin>>n;
	    string s;
	    cin>>s;
	    int c=0;
       for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
 
        if (s[i] != s[n - i - 1]) {
            c++;
        }
    }
    if(n%2==0 && c%2!=0)
    cout<<"No"<<endl;
    else
    cout<<"Yes"<<end;
	}
	return 0;
}
